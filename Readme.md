# Overview

This library implements a numeric up down WPF control that can be used to edit integer values:
- with a textbox or
- up/down arrow (repeat) buttons

There is a demo application that shows the usage of the control (LIght/Black themes enabled) and documents the features, such as, the ability to configure a minimum and maximum value that can be used to keep the resulting value within a given bound.
